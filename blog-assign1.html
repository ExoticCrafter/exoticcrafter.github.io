                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    As part of the Technology and Information System (SECP1513) course, my group and I participated in the UTMDigital Open Day held on October 28–29, 2025. During this two-day event at the Dewan Seminar, we immersed ourselves in the local digital ecosystem by attending expert-led talks and exploring booths from multinational corporations like Microsoft and TrendMicro. Our primary task was to document this journey through a Video Blog (Vlog), which involved interviewing staff and analyzing the organization’s digital infrastructure and services. This assignment allowed us to see firsthand how the theoretical concepts we study in class are implemented in a professional IT environment

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> What I Gained</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through the talks by Mohd Hafiz Muhammad Nasir and Hj Madradzi bin Muhammad, I gained a deep understanding of Digital Infrastructure and Information Systems, which are core to my Data Engineering studies. I also gained valuable soft skills by overcoming my camera shyness to conduct professional interviews with UTMDigital staff regarding their technical services. This experience helped me visualize the real-world application of system development and data management within a large-scale organization

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-arrow-up"></i> Areas for Improvement</h3>
                    <p>
                        The primary area for improvement is my team’s internal communication and coordination, as miscommunication allegedly led to a lower grade than we anticipated. I realized that a lack of consistent updates within the group made the video production process more difficult and less efficient. In the future, I plan to initiate more frequent "sync" sessions and use collaborative tools to ensure every team member is aligned with the project goals and rubric requirements.

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-comment-dots"></i> Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>
                        The UTMDigital Open Day was highly impactful because it sparked genuine excitement for my future career by bridging the gap between academic theory and industry reality. I feel that visiting a real-world IT organization helped me learn the course material better than a traditional classroom setting could. Ultimately, the insights provided by the helpful UTMDigital staff and the exposure to industry leaders confirmed that I am on the right path in my Data Engineering journey
